# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: 'props' which is short for properties is a keyword used in React that indicates a property assigned to a variable in a parent file is being passed to a child file.

  Researched answer: Props, or properties, are arguments that are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. They serve the purpose of allowing the flow of data in a React app to be dynamic.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: DOM stands for 'Display Object Module'. A DOM event refers to specific written code whose purpose is to affect the presentation on a user interface.

  Researched answer: Document Object Model (DOM) events function to handle provide information about the events to the script. An event can be triggered by user interaction or by the browser. 



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP is a coding language that focuses on manipulation of objects. I am unsure of how to best communicate the difference between it and functional programming.

  Researched answer: OOP is a programming model that is used to build software that focuses on data, or objects, insetaed of functions and logic. This model works well for large, complex, actively updated programs due to its reusability, scalability, and efficiency. 

  Data is stored and transformed with the used of objects in OOP, however functional programming does not allow such and data can only be manipulated through creation of functions.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float allows for the display or manipulation of numbers with decimal places, whereas and integer is a number without consideration of decimal place.

  Researched answer: Any number without a decimal is considered an integer and any number that contains a decimal is considered a float. Float is ideal when working with calculations because it allows for access to more precise values.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return means that Ruby executes code without the use of the keyword 'return'.

  Researched answer: Ruby is programmed to return the resul of the last evaluated expression, thus they keyword 'return' is not needed, though it may still be used explicitly.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: A type of variable that begins with the '@' symbol and is used to give objects a unique space to STORE data.

2. PostgreSQL: An open-source object-relational database whose inception began in 1986 at UC Berkeley. It runs on all major operating systems, and has compatibility with many programming languages and Library interfaces.

3. Ruby on Rails: A server-side full-stack framework that provides default structures for a database, web service, and web pages. 

4. ORM: Object-relation mapping creates a layer between a coding language and a database that helps with running queries without having to write SQL code. The mapping explains how objects are related to different tables and the ORM uses that information to generate SQL that will insert, update, create and delete data when prompted to do so based on manipulation of an object.

5. Active Record: An ORM, a user interface that performs relational mapping of objects to databases, shielding a programmer from performing "raw" SQL queries.
